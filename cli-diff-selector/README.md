# CliDiffSelector

This subfolder contains the website of the angular-cli-diff project. It was generated with 
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you 
change any of the source files.

## angular/cli versions

The `@angular/cli` versions that should appear on the website are located in the `src/assets/versions.json` file. 
During the automated build the build server extracts all available version strings from the branches present in the 
git-repo and populates the json-file accordingly.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` 
flag for a production build.
